** DO NOT OPEN NEW PULL REQUESTS AGAINST THIS REPOSITORY **

This repository has not been marked archived/read-only, as we do periodically
update the list of packages and/or their constraints. However, this repository
is a _metapackage_, and is only used to install the various packages listed in
its `composer.json`.

Only open a pull request that will update existing package constraints; all
other requests will be closed.
