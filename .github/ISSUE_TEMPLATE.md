** DO NOT OPEN NEW ISSUES ON THIS REPOSITORY **

This repository has not been marked archived/read-only, as we do periodically
update the list of packages and/or their constraints. However, this repository
is a _metapackage_, and is only used to install the various packages listed in
its `composer.json`.

If you find an issue, you should determine which package is responsible, and
report against the correct package repository. As an example, if you see an
exception reported that mentions `Zend\Db\Exception\RuntimeException`, this
indicates an issue with the zend-db package, and should be reported against the
zendframework/zend-db repository.

In the majority of cases, we will close any new issues without comment.
