# Getting Support

Zend Framework offers the following support channels:

- For real-time questions, use our
  [chat](https://zendframework-slack.herokuapp.com)
- For detailed questions (e.g., those requiring examples) use our
  [forums](https://discourse.zendframework.com/c/questions/components)

**DO NOT** use the issue tracker to ask questions; use chat or the forums for
that. Questions posed to the issue tracker will be closed.

At this time, this repository has not been marked archived/read-only, as we do
periodically update the list of packages and/or their constraints. However, this
repository is a _metapackage_, and is only used to install the various packages
listed in its `composer.json`. As such, please direct issue reports and patches
to the appropriate component package repositories.
